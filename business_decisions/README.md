# Business decisions project

Together with the marketing department, we've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. We will prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

Goal of the project: make a decision based on the test decide whether the test was successful or not and whether it is worth continuing after the first month.
